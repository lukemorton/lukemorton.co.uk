# Hiatus Over

Where I explain what I've been up to.

When I moved from the startup world of uncertainty to a little more certain
world of [delivering web apps][made], e-commerce and otherwise, my writing
slowed. Getting your knowledge down, distilling it into written form is an
important part of consuming information. So here I am back ready to distill
my current thought processes about the world wide web.

Moving to [Made][made], introducing [continuous delivery pipelines][cd],
bringing agile rails to [teams][cdp] who want to modernise, writing for
[Made's blog][made-blog] and [hiring][richard] fledgling developers has been
a career changer for me. It's all very exciting stuff!

The opportunities presented at Made Tech are eye openers and exciting but I'm
also very busy. Being pushed into blogging with the rest of our team has only
highlighted the neglect I've been giving my own site. I am pretty opinionated
but I also hope I'm a conduit for interesting conversations, I want to put more
effort into my personal blogging.

Over the past year and a half my idealism has been balanced out with a healthy
sense of pragmatism. I am a fan of using [the][rails] [tools][chef]
[available][jenkins] rather than [reinventing][lily] [several][marionetta]
wheels. That said, I always have my idealism as an end goal, it's just one
I'm getting more and more relaxed about not reaching.

Functional programming is still having a huge impact on the way I see systems
and components interacting. I'm an avid fan of map/reduce and using more basic
constructs of arrays and hashes eeks into my rails work. I'm testing like crazy
these days at both the [feature and unit][testing] level.

As I work with teams and improve our workflows, my understanding of agile is
growing. There are no magic bullets to controlling and delivering projects, but
the understanding that it's always a human issue and that conversation beats
any tool and process is now engrained in me.

I hope over the coming weeks and months I will be able to share some of my more
personal journeys through the web.
