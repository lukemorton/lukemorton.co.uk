<h1>This Kid, This Man</h1>

<p>
I once knew this kid,<br />
He was unbelievable.<br />
Those times were&mdash;<br />
Moments irretrievable.
</p>

<p>
He'd do anything to please,<br />
The parties monkey,<br />
Knew the facts with an ease,<br />
Quirky, weird, funky.
</p>

<p>
Acting not on his own wit,<br />
On the thoughts around,<br />
Slave to the fraternity,<br />
He moved to that sound.
</p>

<p>
The people did like him too,<br />
All was good and true,<br />
Then soon the mood had changed,<br />
Clouds begun to brew.<br />
</p>

<p>
Realising no one knew him,<br />
Fig'ring motives ill,<br />
Thought to himself quietly,<br />
What time he did kill.
</p>

<p>
Lacking certain confidence,<br />
He was now to change,<br />
Strengthening self-evident,<br />
Oh how he did change.
</p>

<p>
Soon was dead and transcending<br />
To a soulful plain,<br />
Didn't see him anymore,<br />
Clouds begun to rain.
</p>

<p>
Touched by that cold dark'n'ness,<br />
Had a stoner's charm,<br />
You could tell he fears no more,<br />
See's to no self harm.
</p>

<p>
I now know this man,<br />
He is unbelievable,<br />
These time are&mdash;<br />
moments irretrievable.
</p>
