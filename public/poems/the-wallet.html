<h1>The Wallet</h1>
<p>Its a dizzy night not sure whats happening,<br />
As the hours disappear brain cells begin to fade,<br />
Smiles all around turn to angry frowns,<br />
The feelings become tense and the accusations begin.</p>
<p>The wallet disappeared, everyone questions,<br />
Sadness enshrowds the victim who stands alone,<br />
How could a friend betray the trust of bretheren,<br />
Then darkness kills off all glamourous reflections.</p>
<p>Another night starts off not so innocent,<br />
This time a new wallet purchased in hope and dispair,<br />
Hoping that this time karma is not opposing,<br />
But it seems that all can occur is more affliction.</p>
<p>The trouble is judgment is impaired,<br />
Whenever the Fridy progresses into Saturday,<br />
The rooms begins to fill, with emotions once again,<br />
Anger entails thee, when war is declared.</p>
<p>With the emptying of the fine rolling papers,<br />
A third weekend dawns, pockets barely full this time,<br />
Pennies exchanged for another leather pouch,<br />
But karma has not quite finished its capers.</p>
<p>Once again it vanishes as the addictions are treated,<br />
The simple soul is trampled on, what once was a fine ego,<br />
Nothing more he can do nor say to make matters mellow,<br />
For he has nothing to gain or loose since he is defeated.</p>
