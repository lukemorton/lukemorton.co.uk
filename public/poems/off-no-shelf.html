<h1>Off No Shelf </h1>
<p>One color, two color, three color, four,<br />
The more thats done, the needed amount is more,<br />
Costs to much, in gold and tears,<br />
Shadows follow you everywhere through the years.</p>
<p>Spiralling into a deep black hole,<br />
The only way to see color is to fill the bowl,<br />
Spirits dwindelling, Souls deminishing,<br />
Relationships dying, Lives ending.</p>
<p>There isn't a light at the end of the tunnel,<br />
No way to sniff your way out, keep falling through the funnel,<br />
The tunnels gettin thinner, so are the clients,<br />
A few strong people try to be acting defiant.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, theres no exit,<br />
The man who said use does not render a man happy gets it,<br />
Just a spirilling hole that gets ever deeper,<br />
Trying to climb out is like climbing ever steeper.</p>
<p>So this is a message from me to you,<br />
Advising you never to be a fool too,<br />
Life wont get better with depending, <br />
Like I said its never ending,<br />
Look for what you need inside yourself, <br />
You won't just get it off no shelf!</p>
