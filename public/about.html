					<h1>Some self indulgence</h1>
				</header>
				<p>I write software. For a living, for fun, to solve problems. I go to work to write code, I go home to write some more code. I even program &mdash; in my head atleast &mdash; as I walk, drive, eat, sleep. You get the picture, I like what I do.</p>
				
				<p>Code is my passion. Every day I'm looking over something new; we are so lucky in our industry to have such a constant stream of fresh thinking. I love to read about new languages, libraries, other's ideas on what best practices are and anything else I can find on the web.</p>

				
				<h2>What I do</h2>
				<p>I am currently a web developer for <a href="http://freeola.com">Freeola</a> writing web applications such as our <a href="http://freeola.com/website-builder/">InstantPro SiteBuilder</a> and our <a href="http://freeola.com/webmail">new webmail client</a>.</p>
				
				<p>In my spare time I stalk <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> looking for inspiration, I also maintain some of <a href="http://github.com/DrPheltRight">my own repositories</a> there. I also read many blogs through Google Reader, I'll be sure to share my list soon.
				
				
				<h2>What I use</h2>
				<p>Like I've already said I try and learn new technologies all the time so I have a varied amount of interest in a lot of things. Here are the languages I use in order of my familiarity, most to least:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>, the language I started out with and the language I use at work (most).</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">JavaScript</a>, both client side and server side. I play with node.js a fair amount.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, I use various <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/">provisioning</a> tools and <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">deployment</a> strategies that utilise Ruby, along with using it for awesome prototyping with sinatra.</li>
					<li><a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>, the wonderful new dialect of JavaScript. I hope to get more involved with the <a href="http://brendaneich.com/2011/01/harmony-of-my-dreams/">harmony project</a> for injecting some love back into JS.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, the ultimate scripting language for getting shit done on a wide variety of platforms. I play around with Python but don't use it for much.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/tsshell.html">Shell script</a>, of course this counts! I write Makefiles and other command line helper files. Other tools can seem attractive, but simplicity wins over favour.</li>
				</ol>
				
				
				<h2>What I plan to do</h2>
				<p>At the moment &mdash; being 21 &mdash; I have my life ahead of me. For now I simply plan to improve my skills by practicing in what I love. I am trying to find more avenues to meet like minded people such as conferences and smaller meetups.</p>
				
				<p>Another aim of mine is to start programming in C dialects. It's a major language and I can't really call myself a programmer until I write a library in C.</p>
				
				<p>So anyway, enough rambling from me. Feel free to get in touch through any one of the <em>avenues</em> at the top of the page.</p>
