    <h1>Moon &amp; Fate</h1>
    <p class="credits"><small>Written by Luke Morton, 16<small>th</small> August 2012</small></p>

    <p>So much did Moon want to be a star. For years he collected dust as it fell from the sky. A prisoner to his ideal, chained to his cave, he dreamed.</p>

    <p>Fate seeing Moon's determination granted his wish with a single condition: that Moon hand over the dust he had so carefully collected.</p>

    <p>Moon seeing the dust as he always had, his ticket to the stars, willfully handed his purse containing his hopes and dreams to Fate.</p>

    <p>Swiftly Fate sprinkled the star dust over Moon's face and placed him between Earth and the stars, tethered so that he could never truly reach his goal.</p>

    <p>Moon asked Fate why he be so cruel as to tease him for his dreams.</p>

    <p>In reply Fate said:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Moon why do you doubt my actions? I've seen your strength in collecting all this dust for aeons. The determination behind this strength is true to itself but itself is not the truth. The truth dear Moon is that you've been among the stars all along.</p>
      <p>I tether you so you may remind the world and yourself that the only difference between reality and a dream is perception."</p>
