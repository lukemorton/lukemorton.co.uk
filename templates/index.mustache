  Like both the atoms that make us and the systems that comprise the universe in
  which we live, the Internet is a complex organism that we explore daily.
</p>

<p>
  Here you will find a collection of my thoughts on the Internet and the systems
  that make it so complex. You will also find some of those thoughts realised in
  the form of open source code. Hopefully the resources contained within these
  HTML walls will encourage you to explore for yourself this rich and
  interesting landscape.
</p>

<p>
  You can find a little more about me <a href="{{about_url}}">here</a> and
  please do get in touch via twitter
  <a href="{{twitter.url}}">{{twitter.handle}}</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, everything you find here is yours to keep unless licensed otherwise.
