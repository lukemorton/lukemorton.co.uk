        </h1>

        <p>
          This guide is for new and established{' '}
          <mark>software development teams</mark> working in organistions that
          understand software isn't just a necessityÂ â€“Â it's the mechanism by
          which they will achieve their mission and purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software is the pervasive technology of the 21st century. As the
          private, public and third sectors adapt their operating models to have
          software at both the forefront and foundation of their services, they
          have to transform into internet-era organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the core of these organisations are the teams who produce the
          software that drives their success. These teams must adapt to
          ever-changing market and environmental conditions. They aren't part of
          a production line working in widget factories â€“ they are problem
          solvers and innovators and need to be empowered as such.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this guide you will find: articles on what a successful team looks
          like, how to set one up for success, technical advice for evolutionary
          architectures, team practices and importantly how to have fun while
          delivering working software.
        </p>

        <p>
          The guide is a work in progress, with new content released weekly. You
          can sign up for updates by email below. Enjoy and good luck out there!
