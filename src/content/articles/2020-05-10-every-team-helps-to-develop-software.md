# <span class="large">Every team helps to develop software</span>

On how truly digital organisations include every team in their software development process. In order to deliver working software organisational leadership, back office and frontline staff, and users, must be represented in the software development team.

As traditional sales and service channels are replaced by digital means, software has been brought to the organisational frontline as well as the back office. Software now impacts every member of staff in their day-to-day.

Technology startups embrace the symbiotic relationship between software and how they provide their services, pivoting and iterating both their business model and their software together; they are able to sense and respond quickly. Every team in a technology startup is part of the software development process.

This is why disrupted organisations such as banks have to play catch up, feature by feature, rather than being able to innovate both their services and software side by side. They have not embraced a sense and respond approach, they have not empowered their software development teams, and they haven't got every team in the organisation feeding into the process.

For organisations to be transformed then they must ensure every team is represented in the software development team.

## Balancing user and organisational needs

The value that users derive from your software is in enabling them to meet their needs. Users are using your software to complete a task; they might be buying new clothes, renewing a driving license or preparing end of month accounts. For users to do that successfully the [software must too be usable](https://lukemorton.tech/articles/what-is-a-software-development-team#they-develop-working-software).

All too often software is shaped to solve organisational rather than user needs. Why did I have to confirm my email address with Atlassian as I logged into Trello when I've been signed up to Trello for years? Why did I have to jump through confusing hoops, in this example a multistep form, completely unrelated to my own needs of using Trello? I then found that my username all over Trello changed to an outdated username from my days of using BitBucket. To resolve that I had to sign into Atlassian once again and change my details there, just so my colleagues I shared Trello boards would stop teasing me about my old gamer username.

Of course, organisational and user needs must be balanced. After all, it is organisational resources being spent on software so that the organisation's own needs are met. An e-commerce business wants to sell its wares in order to generate revenue and profit. That's the organisational value derived from e-commerce software.

The important thing for organisations to remember is that in order for its needs to be met sustainably, its software must also meet the needs of its users. If your e-commerce store sucks and you've got competition: your revenue will not be sustainable. If you don't have competition: you are a sitting duck awaiting disruption.

It is therefore critical to represent both sets of needs in your team. The whole team ought to be empathetic towards both users and the organisation. User researchers and designers in particular can help focus the team on user needs but design and research should be a team sport that everyone is involved in. Subject-matter experts can also be included in your team in order to represent organisational policy and users within your team.

## Supporting staff

Software is critical to staff that use it to interact with customers or colleagues and to perform their role. There is a huge opportunity to close the feedback loop by ensuring your software development team works closely with staff users.

Collocating your team with the staff who will use the software they are building will enable fast feedback opportunities. Just walk your laptop over to a potential staff member and get that feedback. No need to wait for testing labs in a week or twos time.

By working closely with staff, you can not only digitise their processes but transform the way they work altogether. Coming back to the symbiotic relationship technology startups have between business model and software, you can create this symbiotic relationship between your software development team and staff users.

By mapping the processes of service areas, you can help staff get a better understanding of the way they work and this provides them with tools to self-reflect on their process and how it might be improved regardless of technology. It even provides an opportunity to support and challenge them by showing the art of the possible with software.

## Empowered to challenge

Organisational leadership must be represented from within the team. Your team needs the leadership capability needed to make prioritisation decisions. The leadership with the team ought to be able to defend the teams ability to pivot and adjust their plan based on their learnings.

You aren't necessarily going to be able to have the CEO of your organisation as part of your team on a daily basis; not even your CIO or CTO will be able to afford that kind of evolvement if your organisation is at any kind of scale.

What you should be able to do however is have a service or product owner empowered to make decisions on the organisations behalf involved in your team on a regular basis. Your design and technical leaders within the team should also be able to make decisions autonomously on the organisations behalf regarding usability and feasibility.

This leadership must be able to challenge the wider organisation. If issues outside the remit of the team are blocking progress, if policy and service areas need to be informed by learnings from the software development process, then the leadership within the team has a responsibility and must be able to challenge the organisation.

## Software is a good excuse for organisational change

Software and digital transformation in general presents a great opportunity for organisational change. By acting more like technology startups, slow moving organisations can begin to embrace change more readily. Even governments could benefit too from a sense and respond approach to policy.

Only when your software development team embraces the wider organisation and users can they realise the true value of the software they are creating.
