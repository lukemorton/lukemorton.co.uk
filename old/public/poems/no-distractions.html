<h1>No Distractions</h1>
<p>People with busy lives, live day by day,<br />
They all have things to say,<br />
Like I love you, I really do,<br />
But busy lives keep you saying what you wanna do,<br />
Whats the score? Whos she with?<br />
Daily occupations, over-ride our fellings without a give,<br />
Well this is my one message, before I'm distracted,<br />
Omg I love you, so physically attracted.</p>
<p>From the first time we spoke, we got on so well,<br />
How crazy it is how quick we fell,<br />
Talking and joking nightly, all night,<br />
Other girls I thought I liked, oh how I tried to fight,<br />
But the feelings in my heart, and in my head,<br />
I knew I just wanted to take you to bed.</p>
<p>I know you all over, down to your favourite skittle,<br />
Your my best friend, never feeling little,<br />
I can say anything to you, I'd do anything you know,<br />
When we speak from out of our distractions, my feet just go,<br />
Picking myself off the floor, friends knocking at the door,<br />
Thinking about answering, but I just don't care anymore.</p>
<p>
When I think of you, the feelings are so strong,<br />
Stronger than a cup of coffee, or a suck of my bong,<br />
Sometimes when I think of you, I feel sick,<br />
Not nice I know, but these emotions are just so thick,<br />
Too much thinking, your like a drug to me,<br />
Just need your voice, your touch to make me be free.</p>
<p>
When I don't get you, it just hurts so much,<br />
Thats why I feel sick, I love you too much,<br />
But in these busy lives, I will have to let go,<br />
Once you have read this message, alteast you will know,<br />
You will know how I feel, that I love you,<br />
Nothing will change or budge, not even the flu,<br />
Now its time to fly, and say goodbye to you,<br />
I love you Girl, I hope you love me too!</p>
