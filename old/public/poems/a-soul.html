<h1>Where</h1>
<p>I must have been a giant in a previous draft,<br />13
When my soul bleeds, it feels like centuries have past,<br />12

No way do I want to be here, heart on sleave,<br />11
It's just where I have landed, one of make belief,<br />12

A barron land where my only companions: mirages,<br />15
Sadness can't even fill clouds, this land seems emotionless,<br />14

I can't understand why would I be so abandoned,<br />13
The cold of night leaves me quivering in my covers,<br />13

Foetus like, but without a mothers touch and comfort,<br />13
The walls that surround your fortress keep me at bay,<br />12

How can it be, please let me in, I just need to say&mdash;<br />13 --
The life that has both forgone and not begun,<br />11

I feel I have a life to lead but it's leading me nowhere,<br />
Once again my thoughts collect and soul fills with dispair.</p>
