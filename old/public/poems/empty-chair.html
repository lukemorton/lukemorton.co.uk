<h1>Empty Chair</h1>

<p>The chair over there,<br />
All empty over there,<br />
Opposite and although<br />
worn n torn it sits bear,<br />
Looks it should be<br />
more occupied than nie,<br />
Yet empty for years,<br />
Please sit there for me.</p>

<p>Feelings of a thriller,<br />
Spreading into every mirror,<br />
The pain of loneliness,<br />
Looks like dead furniture,<br />
Everywhere alone feels...<br />
so empty and fearful,<br />
Grabbing at threads<br />
the chair will never be occupied.</p>

<p>After an eyes blink,<br />
The truth is not as you think,<br />
Flickers of reality begin,<br />
The glass begins to clink,<br />
Nothing is there but air,<br />
Hold on a second there,<br />
Blink, person, blink,<br />
Are you sure no one is there?</p>

<p>Souls revolve as electrons,<br />
Around their empty thrones,<br />
Clashing yet not touching,<br />
Any other spirit that roams,<br />
Everyone so blind to reality,<br />
But truth is our ability<br />
To be pure, yet programming,<br />
Our cultural parenting... fuckree.</p>

<p>Through do this and that,<br />
Just like tit for tat,<br />
Our emotions are swapped<br />
for rules and practices,<br />
The same that destroyed<br />
Our ancestors and boy'd-<br />
it is painful and echos<br />
through the family void.</p>

<p>Led to this however, we are not, <br />
The simple fact is all forgot,<br />
You can't look for love,<br />
It is you, your soul, the lot,<br />
So when you stare<br />
at that empty chair, <br />
Try and remember <br />
someone is already sitting there.</p>
