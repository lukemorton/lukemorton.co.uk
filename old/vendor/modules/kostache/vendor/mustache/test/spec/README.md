This repository acts as an attempt at specifying both standard- and edge-case
behavior for libraries parsing Mustache (or a superset thereof).  Early
development will focus on describing idealized output, with later work being
done to normalize expectations.  *It is not expected that any implementation
support any draft prior to v1.0.0.*

As implementers work to build their own parsers, testing scripts may be
contributed to the 'scripts' directory, and code snippets (e.g. for lambdas)
may be provided as well (location TBD).
