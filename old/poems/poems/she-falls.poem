She Falls
Luke, 26/06/2011

In her beauty,
her elegance,
peaceful, she falls.

For a moment,
free but formed,
greatful, she falls.

Knowing of fate,
yet fearless and
defi'nt, she falls.

So delicate,
dainty, composed,
bound, she falls.

Her story told
throughout heaven,
divine, she falls.

Devout till end,
gravity calls,
intense, she falls.

Until the ground,
and she is met,
no more she falls.
